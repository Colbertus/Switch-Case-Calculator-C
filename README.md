# Switch-Case-Calculator-C
The problem is trying make a calculator using a switch statement. A switch statement is similar to an if-then statement, but it checks for specific values rather than specific conditions. The goal is to have a switch statement check for a value under an operator variable, then print the problem and solution based on what was input.

My solution to this problem was to have the switch statement check for a value under the operator variable, or "op". The program first asks what operator would the user like to use. The print statement gives a choice of what valid operators could be used. Then, the program asks for two numbers on which to use the operator. After those numbers get stored, the switch statement then checks what specific value was input for the operator variable. If an invalid operator was input, the program prints an error message and ends the program. Otherwise, the program finds the operator that was used, then prints out the problem and the solution based on the value input to the operator.
